"Sorcerer Lulba 2" Standalone game disk fix Patch (By DrWh0)
------------------------------------------------------------

Since all existing dumps on the internet are based on a 
defective copy provided by TOSEC this game is not playable.

I have created this patch in order to make playable this 
little freeware homebrew game.

This fixes the broken disk image contained in TOSEC releases
and all collections that used the same disk image.

The original name of the file and CRC32 checksum:

Name:  "Lulba 2 (1988)(Compile)(JP).dsk" 
CRC32: 487BADEA

In short, This IPS patch corrects the graphic data corruption
and fixes autoboot feature of other versions.

Special thanks to "imulilla" for providing me the additional
diff chains needed to finish my previous patch
