"Sorcerer Lulba 2" Temporary Compatibility Patch (By DrWh0)
-----------------------------------------------------------

I have created this patch in order to make playable this 
little homebrew game.

Since all existing dumps on the internet are based on a 
defective copy provided by TOSEC this game is not playable.

The critical error is due to the fact that the file 
"LUL2D.DAT" has been extracted from a defective disk.

This file contains the graphic data that is copied into 
the VRAM in order to be used when game starts, but the 
header, as well as several parts of the file are damaged 
getting an invisible error message preventing this game 
from being playable.

I have created a new header and repaired some parts that
were obviously damaged and easily replaced with certain 
values in consistency to the structure of later games, but 
since those are graphic resources I cannot reconstruct 
them because I would be literally creating the graphics.

Therefore, this is a TEMPORARY patch that allows you to 
play and complete the game, in spite of some defective
graphics, like the life bar.

I need a copy of the file "LUL2D.DAT" or a complete good 
disk image of the game so I can build a proper IPS patch
to repair faulty copies that populate the internet.

If you have the original or a disk image in good working 
order of:

"Sorcerer Lulba 2 (Compile) (1988)" 

Please, contact me as soon as possible.
