"Sorcerer Lulba 1" English IPS translation patch by DrWh0
=========================================================

I made this IPS patch file in order to ease the patching
of this translation from japanese to english using a non
MSX computer.

Original translation and .MIA patches were made by:

MSX Translations & BiFi

Why this patch instead of original .MIA files?
==============================================

I did this IPS patch for your convenience because 
.MIA files are hard to use for rookies or non native
MSX users.

MIA patching is annoying because you need to:

Decompress the original .DSK from Tosec & derivatives

Rename the "AUTOEXEC.BAS" to "LULBA.BAS" and back

Use commandline from a msx-dos computer

With this patch you only need Lunar IPS or the patcher
you usually use click on the .IPS provided and your 
disk image.

Also I duplicated "LULBA.BAS" file into "AUTOEXEC.BAS"
in order to have the added autoboot feature intact.

Original TOSEC file (& derivatives) to patch:

Name:  "Lulba (1988)(Compile)(JP).dsk"
CRC32: 884CA1E8
